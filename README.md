# model-metadata
collection of hydrodynamic model metadata in the McCormack-Williamson Tract area for SFEI project

This repository is intended as a gathering place for information regarding hydrodynamic modeling efforts (past and present) in and around the McCormack-Williamson Tract. 

It is in response to requests from Bethany Hackenjos (bhackenjos@flowwest.com) at Flow West, which is subcontracting with the San Francisco Estuary Institute for their McCormack-Williamson Tract Restoration Project.

In the main text file, the following bullets should be answered for each project:
1.  Project/Model title
2.  Description
3.  Contact information
4.  Geospatial extent (include filename of uploaded shapefile, if available)
5.  Flows modeled
6.  Dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D)
7.  Resolution (cell dimensions, XS spacing)
8.  Platform (HEC-RAS, Delft, etc.)
9.  Calibrated and verification performed (yes or no + type)
10.  Purpose
11. Date of model completion
12. Date and resolution of underlying elevation data (topography and bathymetry)
13. Availability to public or third party entities
