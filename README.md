## Collection of hydrodynamic model metadata in the McCormack-Williamson Tract area for SFEI project

This repository is intended as a gathering place for information regarding hydrodynamic modeling efforts (past and present) in and around the McCormack-Williamson Tract. 

This is being done in response to requests from Bethany Hackenjos (bhackenjos@flowwest.com) at Flow West, as part of the San Francisco Estuary Institute McCormack-Williamson Tract Restoration Project.

In the main text file (MWT_HydrodynamicModelingMetadataWIP.md), the following bullets should be answered for each project:
1.  Project/Model title
2.  Description (include filename of uploaded documentation file, if available)
3.  Contact information
4.  Geospatial extent (include filename of uploaded shapefile, if available)
5.  Flows modeled
6.  Dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D)
7.  Resolution (cell dimensions, XS spacing)
8.  Platform (HEC-RAS, Delft, etc.)
9.  Calibrated and verification performed (yes or no + type)
10.  Purpose
11. Date of model completion
12. Date and resolution of underlying elevation data (topography and bathymetry)
13. Availability to public or third party entities
